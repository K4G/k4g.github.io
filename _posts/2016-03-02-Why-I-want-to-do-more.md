title: Why I want to do more
---


Hey, I’m Kiley. This is my introductory post. It kinda describes in a nutshell what I’m perseverating on at the moment. It isn’t  a numbered list and doesn’t consist of any internet research (yet). But, if that type of thing interests you, then continue.

I’ll start by saying i’m very analytical in a very non scientific way. I’m a numbers person, have a Masters in Finance and have worked with spreadsheets for years. I’ve turned this into an advantage for me because I can track and measure every experiment in my life. Which, by the way, everything I do is an experiment and this blog will feature many of them. 

By experimenting and measuring, I am allowing myself to do more by only continuing with the things that gives me the best results. The reason for wanting to do more spans a lot of my life. From things/experiences  I want to give my family to the example I want to set for my daughter to the inspiration I want to be for those I come into contact with. I love meeting people who are not only driven, but mindful and efficient in their work.

Time is a serious implication in human lives. Most tend not to dwell on it too much and that is probably a good thing, but the realization that we can only do so much in a day and there are only so many days in our lives is one everyone should have. It is not something that is sad or demotivating, rather it is inspirational that I have a defined term and peaceful knowing that at some point I’ll pass on and leave my burdens behind. 

The time implication is the real root of what is going on here. Since time is our most valuable resource we should always be looking for a ways to get things done faster. To specify, we should focus on learning faster and improving faster, not spending less time with family, meditating, or doing the things we love. In fact, improving faster gives us more time  to do the things we love, which has the effect of making the days feel longer because you are full of good emotions and at peace. 

The second implication of wanting to do more is to increase my likelihood of experiencing as much as possible. I do believe to a certain extent good fortune (as in luck) has a lot to do with how much you progress in a career, but luck is where hard work meets opportunity. I.e. preparation meets a need. The more prepared I am, the more likely it is that i’ll stumble upon a need that I can meet, so i am creating my own luck. Therefore, increasing my odds of success.

Being good at something is one of the most pleasurable experiences in my life. I know there is a lot of different types of people in the world, But I think this is pretty much a universal truth. Being good at something gives the opportunity to be successful which can then translate into whatever your heart desires.

I have plans and goals for my life that I desire. My true contentedness lies in achieving certain things. Instead of wasting my current days dreaming about what I’ll have someday, I am dedicated to learning as much as possible as quick as possible to make the future come faster. 

Learning fast is the key. 

There are three basic learning skills. 

>1. The search for information (reading, discussing, finding the secrets of masters)
>2. Remembering the information (memory)
>3. Applying the information (practice)

I have a mnemonic device that I use to remember this which is also a primer for a future post. 

Think of learning like a faucet. The search represents turning on the cold water the handle of which is a compass, remembering is represented by the warm water, which is turned on by twisting a hard drive. Both flowing out at the perfect temperature is applying the information. It takes the perfect mix of hot and cold to achieve the perfect temp, which I consider practice. 

Peace!
