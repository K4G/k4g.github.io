How to memorize the first 100 digits of Pi.

That crazy assortment of words has the first 100 digits of Pi locked up in it. I’ll show you how to fish it out. 

The lessons learned in this post can be translated into memory in general. It is a very valuable skill. 

Let’s start with the phonetic alphabet. The numbers next to the digits are representative of the sound only. Like the S in sow represents 0.

- 0 s, z (e.g. Sow)
- 1 t, d, th (e.g. Tie)
- 2 n (e.g. Noah)
- 3 m (e.g. Ma)
- 4 r (e.g. Row)
- 5 l (e.g. hiLL)
- 6 j, ch, sh (e.g. SHoe)
- 7 c, k, g, q, ck (e.g. Cow)
- 8 v, f, ph (e.g. hiVe)
- 9 p, b (e.g. Bee)

So, as an example “tie cow” would equal the number 17. Tokyo would also equal 17. Vowels don’t represent numbers, focus only on the sounds your mouth is making, not the letters of the words. Another example is enough. The first sound we come to is n, which equals 2 the second is the f sound formed by the gh. So, enough would equal 28. Are you getting it?

Commit that to memory and the rest is a piece of cake. Now, it should be said that different people order the phonetic alphabet differently in this technique and you should do whatever makes the strongest association in your head. Just make sure you get those 10 sounds associated with one of the 10 single digits. 

Now, Let us have a look at the beast.

That is a lot of digits and semi-intimidating, but only in appearance. 

Now, remember the crazy words at the top of this post that didn’t make any sense? 

That represents all 100 digits of Pi through the phonetic alphabet system you just learned. Now you just have to remember the words in the correct order, and that is easy too. 

Here is the story. Actually imagine each picture in your head as you read this and you’ll only have to read it a couple of times to remember. I like to use a hybrid method of loci and linked associations. Loci is what ancient orators used to remember their lengthy speeches. They walked themselves through their houses mentally and placed reminders on each of their pieces of furniture. A link is where one thing turns into something else in a way that is out of proportion, exaggerated or undeniably impossible. 

Open your front door (in your head) and see a turtle standing on your doormat, he hits you with a pan that turns your face into jelly. A male is fighting his foe in your living room with the brooms you use to upkeep the man in my fridge. There is no jar in my fridge other than the one mom is in and it has created a famine. Couples resort has enough food in their fort but it is in the pocket of JPM (jpmorgan) He pulls out a Poboy and uses it to make lots of laugh. Noahs pecker is in the poboy and its bearer does a leap with no mask into an Ivy filled Tijers river (I know tigris is the right name, but Tijers works) Joan of Joans (think ultimate level Joan of Arc) rises out of the river to become FOB (Free on Board) on a vessel. She is having a problem with a Bee, Fasho, but Noah Ivys (ivy with Noah Heads for leaves) helps her. Now, Mayor Ivy, passes no law to mourn a tot that touched a cows shoe that was covered in cow poo

Here is the paragraph again, except this time the numbers are beneath the appropriate sound.

That is it. At first it may require you writing out the words and translating the phonetic sounds into the proper digits, but with continued practice you’ll be able to do it in your head and recite it to anyone. The best part about this method is the infinite scalability. You could do a thousand digits with some perseverance. You can also apply this to birthdays, phone numbers, account numbers... etc.
