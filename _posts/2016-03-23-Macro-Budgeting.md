I am a finance guy and I’ve taken accounting courses through all of my undergrad and graduate degrees but still don’t remember if credits go on the right or left and whether they add to or subtract. In short, i’m no bookkeeper and don’t understand how someone with even littler knowledge could be effective at it. But, I do like keeping track of my finances. 

I’ve tried Mint, YNAB...you name it, but I hate having to micro manage the process and categorize expenses. I just want a macro picture of my liquid “net worth” to see whether or not it is growing. 

So, this is what I developed. I set an arbitrary number as a buffer in my checking account, for example we will use \$2,000. That is my baseline. I then spend money as needed on a Credit Card and watch as the balance grows. Then, as I get paid, I pay off the balance of the credit card from the checking account. If, My account balance goes below \$2,000 after my paycheck has been deposited and credit card paid, I spent too much. If I have a surplus, then I transfer it to savings or investment accounts to get my checking account back to $2,000 exactly. It is that easy. 

Granted, this method is really designed for someone getting a paycheck at known intervals, but with thoughtful spending could be adapted to any type of payment schedule. 

Also, I have a built in emergency fund right there in my checking account. $2,000 worth. 

I think transactional budgeting is too much micro-managing and frankly I don’t want to dedicate the time, or mental energy to scrutinizing every dollar that leaves my wallet. So, I just track total net worth with a chart. If it is generally trending up, then i’m doing a good job. ‘

I get the value of all of my savings and investment accounts daily, add them to a row in a spreadsheet and track the total. Of course in doing this you have to net out your liabilities (credit card or other short term debts) to see what the total liquid net worth is. Seeing this macro picture has allowed me to set a more clear vision for my finances and is super low stress and fun to do. 

I have a template (google sheet > [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gp37F4hHZamP1SthWufM2dIMPkSaHZJVsf1Pu12ZdDI/edit?usp=sharing) < try it out below) of exactly what I use. Try it out. You’ll find yourself wanting to do it everyday to see how your personal wealth is growing. The greatest times are when bonuses, tax returns or other windfalls come through and you see a spike in the chart. I immediately move that money to investment accounts so I don’t have the urge to spend it unnecessarily. I know that seeing my net worth grow is much more satisfying than fulfilling a temporary desire.
